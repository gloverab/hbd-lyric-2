# Has this ever happened to you?

You're at a birthday party, and there are a bunch of other guests there. And maybe some of those guests are friends of friends, invited by proxy or out of politeness. We'll call them tangential guests. That's all well and good, and everyone is having a great time.

## Then the cake comes out.

We've all been there.
The host of the party has slyly disappeared.
The lights dim.
The party quiets down.
The guests murmor.
There's a very specific, familiar glow coming from the kitchen.
Some asshole does that loud whistle thing with their two fingers and their tongue that I could never do.

The host emerges, holding a cake and encouraging everyone to sing "Happy Birthday". Everyone has been so taken aback by the spectacle that they mindlessly launch into the song, not giving a second thought as to whether or not they know the lyrics.

**"Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday dear..."**
*oh, shit.*

All those tangential guests drank too many Aperol Spritzes and don't remember the name of the birthday person that they met hours before at the beginning of the night. There's a lull in the otherwise triumphant rendition of this age-old song. The tangentials mumble their way through this line, shifting their eyes and hoping no one notices.

## But we noticed.

And that's why we created Happy Birthday Lyric Generator.
Go ahead. Type a name into the generator on that home screen.
Any name.
It works with all of them.

Don't worry, you can thank us later.
